Shortest distance between two lines

Distance between Two Parallel Lines - The distance is the perpendicular distance from any point on one line to the other line.

Formula to find distance between two parallel line:

Consider two parallel lines are represented in the following form :

y = mx + c1 …(i)

y = mx + c2 ….(ii)

Where m = slope of line

Then, the formula for shortest distance can be written as under : image.png​

If the equations of two parallel lines are expressed in the following way :

ax + by + d1 = 0

ax + by + d2 = 0

then there is a little change in the formula.

How to find Distance between Two Lines

Remark: The perpendicular distance between parallel lines is always a constant, so we can pick any point to measure the distance
